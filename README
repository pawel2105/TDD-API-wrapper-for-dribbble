= Misc

Just some code while learning to use VCR and using HTTParty to write my own API wrappers.

= Install

gem install dribbble_rap

= Test

Open IRB.

simplebits = Dish::Player.new('simplebits')
simplebits.profile => #returns a hash with the data from the Dribbble API

= To-do 

* RSpec + Cucumber version
